Roundtrip is a deep generative neural density estimator which exploits the advantage of GANs for generating samples and estimates density by either importance sampling or Laplace approximation. Since TensorFLow v1 is outdated, this folder provides source code for using Roundtrip with TensorFlow v2. Now Roundtrip is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Roundtrip/), which can be easily installed by `pip`.
