# Tutorials: Roundtrip: density estimation with deep generative neural networks

<a href='https://github.com/kimmo1019/Roundtrip'><img align="left" src="https://github.com/kimmo1019/Roundtrip/blob/master/model.jpg" width="350">

Roundtrip is a deep generative neural density estimator which exploits the advantage of GANs for generating samples and estimates density by either importance sampling or Laplace approximation. 

Since TensorFLow v1 is outdated, this tutorial provides instructions for using Roundtrip with Python3 and TensorFlow v2. Now Roundtrip is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Roundtrip/), which can be easily installed by `pip`.
